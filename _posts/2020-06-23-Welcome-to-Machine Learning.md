The aim of building this website is to create one-stop shop for all the data science topics which are discussed in the present machine learning community.

This website will be launched in a phased manner. Firstly, I will focus on the topics helpful in building regression & classification models for tabular data.
1. Linear algebra for machine learning
2. Feature Engineering Guide
3. Miscelaneous topics in conventional machine learning

In the next phase, we will shift our focus to the Deep Learning related topics and cover 
1. Convolutional Neural networks
2. Intuition behind neural networks
3. Sequence models
4. Attention and Transformers
